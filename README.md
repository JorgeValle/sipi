## About Sipi

Sipi is a web app for Central America and the Caribbean. It's part review site, part urban guide, and part exploration. It's found at [https://sipi.app](https://sipi.app).

## Motivation

Many years ago, I operated a site called Sipi. It was a business review site for El Salvador, my birth country. Even though it was getting really good traffic, I was mostly leveraging libraries, frameworks and CMSs to run it.

As my skills have progressed over the years, I decided to rebuild from scratch, and teach myself Angular 2+ in the process. It has a long way to go in terms of where I'd like it to be, but it's looking good and it's stable.
